The Canadian ARES logos use the "DejaVu Sans" Normal and Bold fonts. These do
not appear correctly if viewing the SVG embedded directly in a web page. This
needs to be fixed.

The official US ARES logo seems to use a font very similar to the cover of QST
Magazine. Contacting persons at the ARRL responsible for the website, logos and
magazine did not yield this information as it appears to have been forgotten.

It would be really swell to find out what the actual name of the font is and
what kind of license it has.

The original contributor of the US ARES logo at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ARES_Color_Logo.svg was done by someone
holding the Wikipedia username "McNeight". It would be really nice to provide
some proper attribution and thanks for this individual as their work provided
the inspiration for the Canadian ARES logos.

No full name or callsign exists in the original file and no contact information
was provided on Wikipedia. No active callsign seems to exist for the surname
"McNeight". The other pages submitted by the user seem to indicate that they
may live in Seattle, Washington and know a fair bit about various commercial
aircraft. It is thought that this person is likely Neil McNeight.
