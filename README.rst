Logos for the Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES)

These logos were drawn in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format [2] for Radio
Amateurs of Canada (RAC) by Tyler Tidman VA3DGN.  Wherever possible, the
Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format [3] is now being used for all generated
bitmaps.  The chosen fonts, "DejaVu Sans Bold" and "DejaVu Sans" [4] are
provided gratis under a free, open-source license.

Inspiration for these logos was provided by the SVG version of the US Amateur
Radio Relay League (ARRL) ARES logo posted on Wikipedia [1] by "McNeight" and
the old RAC logos donated by James Ewen VE6SRV.  French translations were
provided by Tyler Tidman VA3DGN and verified by Serge Langois VE2AWR and Claude
Lalande VE2LCF.  Inuktitut (Inuit) translations were provided by Jamie
Savikataaq and verified by TBD.

Software that was used to create and work with these files:
  - GNU Make (3.81) [5]
  - Inkscape (0.48, 0.47, 0.46) [6]
  - Imagemagick (6.6.0-4, 6.3.7) [7]
  - Debian Linux (7.x, 6.x) [8]

Type "make" to magically generate bitmap versions from the source vector .svg
files.

The embroidery file formats were provided courtesy of Shannon Wheeler-Bradley.
First, the background fill colour was omitted and the circle, text and inset
image components were broken apart into several temporary 400x400 pixel PNG
files to facilitate conversion.  An anchor stitch was placed under a satin
stitch to render the outer circle and to allow for cutting away the surrounding
fabric more cleanly.  The text was drawn using a satin stitch and a fill stitch
was used to render the inner part of the logo.  These intermediate files were
then combined into a single file and converted to various industry standard
closed-source, proprietary formats.
