Logos for the Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES)
Logos pour le Service d'Urgence Radio Amateur (SURA)

These logos were drawn in `Scalable Vector Graphics`_ (SVG_) format for `Radio
Amateurs of Canada`_ (RAC_) by Tyler Tidman VA3DGN.  Wherever possible, the
`Portable Network Graphics`_ (PNG_) format is now being used for all generated
bitmaps.  The chosen fonts, "DejaVu_ Sans Bold" and "DejaVu_ Sans" are provided
gratis under a free, open-source license.

Inspiration for these logos was provided by the SVG version of the US Amateur
Radio Relay League (ARRL) ARES logo posted on Wikipedia by "McNeight_" and the
old `RAC Logos`_ donated by James Ewen VE6SRV.  French translations were
provided by Tyler Tidman VA3DGN and verified by Serge Langois VE2AWR and Claude
Lalande VE2LCF.  Inuktitut (Inuit) translations were provided by Jamie
Savikataaq and verified by TBD.
