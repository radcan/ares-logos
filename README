These logos were drawn in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format [2] for RAC by
Tyler Tidman VA3DGN.  Wherever possible, the Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
format [3] is now being used for all generated bitmaps.  The chosen fonts,
"DejaVu Sans Bold" and "DejaVu Sans" [4] are provided gratis under a free
license.

Inspiration for these logos was provided by the SVG version of the ARRL ARES
logo posted on Wikipedia [1] and the old RAC logos donated by James Ewen
VE6SRV.

Software that was used to create and work with these files:
  - GNU Make (3.81) [5]
  - Inkscape (0.46, 0.47, 0.48) [6]
  - Imagemagick (6.3.7, 6.6.0-4) [7]
  - Debian Linux "Squeeze" and "Wheezy" (6.0, 7.0) [8]

Type "make" to magically generate bitmap versions from the source vector .svg
files.

French translations were provided by Tyler Tidman VA3DGN and verified by Serge
Langois VE2AWR and Claude Lalande VE2LCF.  Inuktitut (Inuit) translations were
provided by Jamie Savikataaq and verified by TBD.  "Amateur Radio Emergency
Service" => tuavirnaqtulirinirmut tusarutialaat => "TBD".

The embroidery file formats were provided courtesy of Shannon Wheeler-Bradley.
First, the background fill colour was omitted and the circle, text and inset
image components were broken apart to produce several temporary 400x400 pixel
PNG files.  An anchor stitch was placed under a satin stitch to render the
outer circle and allow for cutting away the surrounding fabric more cleanly.
The text was drawn using a satin stitch.  A fill stitch was used to render the
inner part of the logo.  These intermediate files were then combined into a
single file and converted to various industry standard proprietary formats.
