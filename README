These logos were drawn in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format [2] for RAC by
Tyler Tidman, VA3DGN.  Wherever possible, the Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
format [3] is now being used for all auto-generated bitmaps.

Inspiration for these logos was provided by the SVG version of the ARRL ARES
logo posted on Wikipedia [1].

Software that was used to work with these files:
  - Inkscape (0.46) [4]
  - Imagemagick (6.3.7) [5]
  - Debian Linux (6.0.3 Squeeze/Stable) [6]

Type "make" to magically generate all .png and .jpg versions from the source
.svg files.
